# Shyp Platform UI Project

This Flutter project is a simple UI for the Shyp Platform. The app allows users to view and manage their orders, with different filters for the order status.

## Screens

- **Main Screen**: This is the home page of the application, which contains two tabs for 'Ongoing' and 'Past' orders.

- **Orders Screen**: This screen displays a list of orders. Users can filter the orders by their status - 'All', 'Pending', or 'In Progress'. Users can also navigate to the detailed tracking screen of each order from here.
